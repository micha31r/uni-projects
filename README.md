A collection of projects I completed for university computing subjects.

## Foundations of Algorithm (COMP10002)

### Assignment 1:

To implement a faster search algorithm using the *learned index* technique
Grade: 20/20

Project breakdown:
* Stage 1: Read Input Numbers, Sort Them, and Output the First Ten Numbers
* Stage 2: Index with a Single Linear Function
* Stage 3: Index with More Linear Functions to Reduce the Maximum Prediction Error
* Stage 4: Perform Exact-Match Queries

Key skills:
* Arrays
* Pointers
* Input processing
* Functions

### Assignment 2:

To develop a simple community detection algorithm
Grade: 19.5/20

Project breakdown:
* Stage 1: Read User Profiles
* Stage 2: Compute the Strength of Connection
* Stage 3: Compute the Strength of Connection Between All Pairs of Users
* Stage 4: Detect Communities and Topics of Interest
* Stage 4.2: 
	* Compute and output all unique hashtags of the users in the community form by each core user, sorted in alphabetical order
	* State the time complexity of the algorithm for this stage

Key skills:
* Structures
* Linked data structures
* Time complexity analysis
